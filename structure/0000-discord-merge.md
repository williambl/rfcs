# The Discord Server Merge

## Summary

The split between Quilt Project's two public Discord servers (The Quilt Community and
The Quilt Toolchain) no longer serves a purpose. The 'The Quilt Toolchain' Discord
shall be archived, its functions being taken over by the 'The Quilt Community' server.

## Definitions

In this document, 'Quiltcomm' shall refer to the discord server called 'The Quilt Community'.
'Toolchain' shall refer to the discord server called 'The Quilt Toolchain'.

## Motivation

The split between Quiltcomm and Toolchain dates back to the beginnings of the project;
its aim was to allow Quilt project developers to have conversations between themselves
without having to interact with the community at large. This decision was made in the
wake of the many community dramas which preceded Quilt's creation, and was hoped to
reduce the chances of any further such things from affecting development.

The split has caused many issues. Development happening in the split-off Toolchain
discord has caused many to feel as though development of the project is done by a group
which is far more exclusive than it ought to be. This results in less people coming
in from the community to help with Quilt development, thus excacerbating the issues
many Quilt projects have of low manpower.

On the other side of the same coin, the split causes exclusivity of Community management;
with many devs rarely or never interacting with the community at large, they become
disconnected from it. This then causes a divide both between them and the project's users,
and between them and the Community Team. A divide between any of these groups is
anathema to a functional and healthy project, the various members of which trust and
work together with one another.

Many developers feel that Toolchain and Quiltcomm feel like different enough places
that they have little connection to Quiltcomm, and so dislike the idea of removing the split.
However, this is itself symptomatic of the problem - there should be no such difference
in the atmosphere of the two spaces.

## Explanation

Toolchain will become a public archive, renamed 'The Quilt Toolchain: Archive'.

Quiltcomm shall be renamed 'The Quilt Project', due to its combined roles.

For each project-specific channel category in Toolchain, a forum channel shall be created in

## Drawbacks

This may result in 'channel bloat' in Quiltcomm. However, this can likely be mitigated
with use of Discord's Onboarding feature.

- What other designs have benefits over this one? Why should we choose an
  alternative instead?

## Unresolved Questions

//TODO

- What should be resolved before this RFC gets merged?
- What should be resolved while implementing this RFC?
- What unresolved questions do you consider out of scope for this RFC, that
  could be addressed in the future?
